## MSR Winter Project - EMG Teleoperation of Adroit Robotic Arm

This repository consists of one main package that is used for controlling an Adroit Robotic Arm using a Myo Armband. The `gesture_control` package contains more information on the nodes and launch files used for interfacing with the Adroit. I am not able to share any repositories or code from the already existing Adroit packages. For any questions contact the Northwestern Center for Robotics and Biosystems. For more information about the project, check out my [portfolio](https://allan-gc.github.io/Adroit.html) post and the gesture_control package. 

Here is a demo video showing full control of the Adroit using the Myo Armband:
